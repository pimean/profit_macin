                        <ul>

                            <li><strong>Sale Revenue:</strong> The revenue generated by selling the product.</li>

                        <h2>What is Margin</h2>
                        <p>In finance, the term "margin" can refer to different things depending on the context.</p>
                        <p>For businesses, it usually refers to the amount by which revenue from sales exceeds costs, expressed as a percentage.</p>
                        <p>This is known as the profit margin, which can also be calculated as net income divided by revenue or net profit divided by sales.</p>
                        <p>The higher the profit margin, the better, as it indicates that the business is earning more than it is spending.</p>
